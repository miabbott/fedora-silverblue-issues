But yes, I think this is best closed - supporting GRUB is hard enough - trying to support GRUB and something in addition, even harder. So, any replacement worth putting effort into would have to be part of a plan to at least eventually replace GRUB entirely.\r\n\r\nThe reason that OSTree doesn't like VFAT is it doesn't allow standard UNIX tricks for atomic changes - there is inevitably an intermediate state where the configuration is corrupt, and if power failure (etc.) occurred at that point, the result would be broken.",

After I played a little bit around with Silverblue my ostree got into a state where no update command where working and \"rpm-ostree status\" did not work and gave a timeout error. I don't even know how to rescue such a system. The normal way with chroot and afterwards making binds for /dev /sys and /proc does not work.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean is:I don't know how many people are out there who will be able to hack OSTree if something goes wrong. In my case the only thing I could do was to reinstall my PC. \r\n",

This was something clear to me that kernel and initrd have both to be placed on a vfat partition.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I have setup some test installation putting kernel and initrd into /boot/efi but this is not maintained by the update process.\r\n",
