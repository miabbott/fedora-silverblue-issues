Although the user can install systemd-boot if he wants to.\r\n\r\nThe script I suggested (see the link above) is enough for me to maintain my setup.\r\n\r\nSo I guess since Fedora will stick to grub nothing more could be done.\r\n",

This was something clear to me that kernel and initrd have both to be placed on a vfat partition.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I have setup some test installation putting kernel and initrd into /boot/efi but this is not maintained by the update process.\r\n",
