There are\r\ndifferent types of talking points for different types of people:\r\ngeneral desktop users/everyone, developers, and sysadmins. They are\r\nmeant to provide a short, effective answer to the question \"What cool\r\nstuff is in the latest release of Fedora?\" They are compelling, not\r\nnecessarily comprehensive.  \r\n\r\nBest Regards.\r\n\r\n[1] https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_29_talking_points",
