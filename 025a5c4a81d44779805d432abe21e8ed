Then, \" rpm-ostree install kmod-nvidia xorg-x11-drv-nvidia\". And finally, use the same kargs from Alex\u2019s nvidia blog post. Worked well. I have not noticed any performance issues.\r\n\r\nThe issue:\r\n\r\nAfter I did a general system upgrade that included an update to the kernal, the akmod no longer worked! I am not sure why the akmod post-scripts didnt execute after kernal update. I havnt found a \u201creal\u201d solution to this problem: my uneducated workaround was to uninstall/install the two nvidia packages, which worked for me.\r\n\r\n[![4FA2B47A-A230-48C3-836E-6A1AE93279AA.png](/fedora-silverblue/issue/raw/files/396b5e574eaddb61db162685b157b695200d3a2e25e9a4a44a31e1ba32f4a79e-4FA2B47A-A230-48C3-836E-6A1AE93279AA.png)](/fedora-silverblue/issue/raw/files/396b5e574eaddb61db162685b157b695200d3a2e25e9a4a44a31e1ba32f4a79e-4FA2B47A-A230-48C3-836E-6A1AE93279AA.png)\r\n",
