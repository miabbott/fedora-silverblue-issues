    "content": "I was able to install nvidia drivers successfully in Silverblue 30.\r\n\r\nI was able to complete install with fedora\u2019s \u201cfedora-workstation-repositories\u201d by enabling \u201crpmfusion-nonfree-nvidia-driver.repo\u201d. Then, \" rpm-ostree install kmod-nvidia xorg-x11-drv-nvidia\". And finally, use the same kargs from Alex\u2019s nvidia blog post. Worked well. I have not noticed any performance issues.\r\n\r\nThe issue:\r\n\r\nAfter I did a general system upgrade that included an update to the kernal, the akmod no longer worked! I am not sure why the akmod post-scripts didnt execute after kernal update. I havnt found a \u201creal\u201d solution to this problem: my uneducated workaround was to uninstall/install the two nvidia packages, which worked for me.\r\n\r\n<!!image>\r\n",
